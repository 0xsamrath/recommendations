## Recommendations

People I've worked with in the past!

  - [aaryaman](https://twitter.com/aaryamvn) - Aaryaman, or as I call him, abno has been one of my closest friends in the coding community since the beginning of my career. He's a great dev and a much better UI designer. His work is super professional and he's super well connected. 100% recommend him for any project you might have
  - [@varun](https://twitter.com/pottivarun) - Varun is super experienced in literally every single stack under the moon. He's worked with rust, go, typescript(frontend and backend), a little bit of python and svelte. He's introduced me to a lot of stacks and a lot of best practices.
  - [tejas](https://twitter.com/xtremedevx) - Tejas, or as he's more commonly known XtremeDevX, is a super experienced dev and founder. He's built multiple package managers and CLIs, if you're looking for a rust/python dev, he's most probably the best person on this list
